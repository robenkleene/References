# Normalizing Splits

- `⌥⌘S`: Split below
- `⌥⌘V`: Split left
- `⌥⌘C`: Close split
- `⌥⌘O`: Close other splits
- `⌥⌘.` / `⇧⌘⌥.`: Focus next / previous split

## Ideas

- Nova uses `⌃backtick` to switch splits, which is useful because it's similar to `⌘backtick` to go to next window. It also combines well with shift to go in the reverse direction. This conflicts with `⌃backtick` in VS Code to show the terminal.
- `⌘⎋` Makes a decent replacement for showing the terminal?

## Remove

Don't use this, because this conflicts with add multiple cursor below, which is a very useful shortcut.

- `⌥⌘←` / `⌥⌘→` / `⌥⌘↑` / `⌥⌘↓`: Focus split in direction

## Folding

- `⌥⌘[`: Fold
- `⌥⌘]`: Unfold
