# Emacs

- As a convention, in the minibuffer `↓` gives the default value (e.g., current filename) and `↑` gives the history for that command.
- Emacs automatically sets the mark when performing an incremental search, so a quick way to copy some text is to incrementally search to where the mark should end, and then `M-w`.
