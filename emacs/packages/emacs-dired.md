* `+`: Create directory

* `D`: Delete file

## Dired Write Mode

* `C-x C-q` or `dired-toggle-read-only`: Change to writable mode
	* `C-c C-c` or `C-x C-s`: Save changes

## File Management

### Copying or Moving Files

- `R`: Rename or move file (`â†“` inserts the current filename)
- `C`: Copy file

With `(setq dired-dwim-target t)`, if two `dired` buffers are open use the other one as the default destination.
