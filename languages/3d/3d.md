# 3D

- CUDA is a proprietary platform developed by Nvidia for for Nvidia cards, OpenCL is an open source, so it's used for AMD cards for example. Metal is Apple's equivalent to CUDA.
- OpenGL is just for graphics programming, OpenCL is general purpose.

## Shaders

### Vertex Shaders

Vertex shaders manipulate coordinates in 3D space and are called once per vertex.

A shape is made up of vertices, a vertex shader is given every vertex in turn, and it sets its final position as a 4D float vector (`gl_Position` in `OpenGL`).

### Fragment Shaders

Fragment shaders define RGBA colors for each pixel.
