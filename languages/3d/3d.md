# 3D

- CUDA is a proprietary platform developed by Nvidia for for Nvidia cards, OpenCL is an open source, so it's used for AMD cards for example. Metal is Apple's equivalent to CUDA.
- OpenGL is just for graphics programming, OpenCL is general purpose.

## Shaders

- Vertex shaders manipulate coordinates in 3D space and are called once per vertex.
- Fragment shaders define RGBA colors for each pixel.
