# WebGL

Things you need to display 3D: Canvas, Scene, Lights, and Mesh.

- `glTF`: Includes materials, animations, cameras, lights, and ambient occlusion. You need to either bake in shadows or enable them (with the JavaScript API) on any lights in your scene.
- `OBJ`: Includes has simple material model (no PBR). But doesn't have lights, cameras, animation, or shadows
