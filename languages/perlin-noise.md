# Perlin Noise

- Perlin noise is rendered in 3D space, and getting the value for `xoff`, `yoff`, `zoff` is getting that value at those coordinates.
- `xoff`: x-offset
- Perlin noise was originally developed for procedural textures of objects.
- Perlin noise gives you smooth random numbers, random numbers that change smoothly over time.
