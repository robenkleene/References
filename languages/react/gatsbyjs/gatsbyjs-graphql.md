# GatsbyJS GraphQL

## GraphiQL

GraphiQL is a GraphQL IDE. To access it in your Gatsby project:

1. Start the development server if it's not already running (`gatsby develop`).
2. Visit `http://localhost:8000/___graphql` in a browser

### Data

You can explore the data in GraphQL by using the sidebar. For example, if you've added Markdown with `gatsby-transformer-remark` then that data will appear under `markdownRemark` (e.g., to see the compiled HTML by clicking "`markdownRemark` > `html`").
