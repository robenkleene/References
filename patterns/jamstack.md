# Jamstack

- JavaScript
- APIs
- Markup


Jamstack all static HTML on the server, those files are returned when an HTTP request comes in, any dynamic content is fetched from the API by the client directly -- the content is then render via client-side JavaScript.

The difference from traditional web development is that when an HTTP request comes in, a static HTML file is returned, rather than that request being interpreted by, say, a Node app.
