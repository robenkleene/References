# Documentation Style Guide

Refer to things you change or enter in backticks, e.g., `10`.

Refer to setting properties like this:

    Set "Attributes: `density`"

Do menu items like this:

    Select "Filter > Blur > Average" from the menu bar

Refer to the menu as the menubar and the toolbar as the toolbar.

## Select vs. Choose

Use select when selecting between multiple objects, such as icons, graphic images, radio buttons, or checkboxes, or when highlighting text.

Use choose for menu items, including those in pop-ups and shortcut menus.

In general, the user selects something, such as a file or disk icon, an email message, or a section of text, and then chooses a command to act on the selection.
