# Unity Glowing Orb

1. Start a new 3D project called `Glowing Orb`
2. Right-click in the Hierarchy and choose `Create Empty` and name it `PS_OrbElectric`
3. Right-click `PS_OrbElectaric` and choose `Effects > Particle System` and name it `Circle`. Select `Circle`, and in the inspector, set `Transform > Rotation > X: -90` so it points straight up.
4. Select `PS_OrbElectric` and set `Transform > Position` `X: -17` and `Y: 3`.
