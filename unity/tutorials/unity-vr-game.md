# Unity VR Game

After setting up a Unity project for VR (e.g., installing `XR Plugin Management`).

## Packages

1. This tutorial uses the `XR Rig` which is part of the `XR Interaction Toolkit`. This is a preview package, so before it will show up in the `Window > Package Manager`, you need to choose `Package Manager > Advanced Project Settings` (this is under the gear icon), then in the new window that opens, toggle on `Package Manager > Advanced Settings > Enable Preview Packages`. After performing these steps, install `XR Interaction Toolkit` from `Window > Package Manager`.

## Setup

1. Right-click in the Hierarchy and choose `3D Object > Plane`. Scale the plane up to around `4.5` by clicking and dragging the inner cube
2. Create a material by right-clicking `Assets` and choosing `Create > Material`. Rename the material to `Black`, and set `Albedo: Black`.
3. Delete the `Main Camera`.
4. Right-click and choose `Create Empty`, and rename it `VR Rig`, click `Add Component` and add a `XR Rig`.
