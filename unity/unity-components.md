# Unity Components

If you edit a component while Unity is playing, when you stop playing, the changes will be lost. To work around this, you can right-click the components header and choose `Copy Component`, then choose `Paste Component Values` after hitting stop.

## Scripts

To add a script, click `Add Component` then type a name for the script and click `New Script`.
