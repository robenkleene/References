# Unity Navigation

## Basic

With the `Hand Tool` selected:

- **Pan:** `Drag` (with the hand tool active, hold `⌥⌘` to activate momentarily)
- **Orbit:** `⌥Drag`
- **Zoom:**: `Scroll`
    - Hold `⇧` to zoom more slowly
    - `⌥Scroll`: This seems to zoom slightly differently, but it's unclear what the difference is exactly

## Shortcuts

- `⌘1`: Scene View
- `⌘2`: Game View

### Tips

- Select an object and hit `F` (or double-click it in the hierarchy) to center it and rotate around it with `⌥drag`.

### Arrow Keys

The arrow keys can move around when the viewport has focus.

### WASD

The WASD keys can be used for movement like a game while the right mouse button is held down *is this possible with a trackpad?*
