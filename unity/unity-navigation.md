# Unity Navigation

- `⌘1`: Scene View
- `⌘2`: Game View

## View

With the `Hand Tool` selected:

- `⌥⌘drag`, `three-finger-drag`: Pan
- `⌥drag`: Orbit
- `two-finger-drag`: Zoom

### Tips

- Select an object and hit `F` (or double-click it in the hierarchy) to center it and rotate around it with `⌥drag`.

### Arrow Keys

The arrow keys can move around when the viewport has focus.

### WASD

The WASD keys can be used for movement like a game while the left mouse button is held down.
