# Unity Troubleshooting

- If the zooming with a two-finger drag seems super sensitivity, then try selecting an object in the scene and hitting `F` to focus it

## Unity Package Manager Error

- Unity Hub downloads two versions of Unity, one at `/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/2020.2.7f1/Unity/Unity.app` and another `/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/2020.2.7f1/Unity.app`. It appears that only the former works and the latter is incomplete. Deleting the latter and replacing it with the former seems to fix this.

## Failed to Load Window Layout

- Just cancel and open it again and it should restore the window layout properly.
