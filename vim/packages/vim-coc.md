# Vim Coc

- If Coc doesn't appear to be working, e.g., if `CocInfo` prints nothing, try running `yarn install` in the `Coc.vim` plugin directory.
- Extensions listed in `g:coc_global_extensions` are auto-installed, old extensions have to be removed manually with `CocUninstall coc-python`.
- Extensions are installed at `.config/coc/extensions/node_modules`
- Extensions cannot be automatically uninstalled, they must be uninstalled with `:CocUninstall`
