# Visual Studio Code Editing

- `⇧⌥F` / `Format Document`: Format document
- `⇧⌘↩`: Insert new line above
- `⌘↩`: Insert new line below

## Multiple Cursors

- `⇧⌘I`: Toggle multiple cursors
- `⎋`: Exit multiple cursors

### Search

- `⌥↩`: Enter multiple cursors for each search match (if this isn't working, it's usually because the search isn't setup correctly, it's a good practice to use `⌥E` then `⌥G` to check that it iterates through the expected matches).

To limit the matches just to the current selection, toggle on "Find in selection" (`⌥⌘L`).
