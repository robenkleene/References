# Visual Studio Code Find & Replace

## Find & Replace in Multiple Files

1. `⇧⌘H`: Find & replace
2. `⌘⌥↩`: Replace all occurrences

## Find & Replace in Selection

1. Select the term to replace and "Find with Selection" (`⌘E`)
2. Make a selection to replace in
3. Open find and replace with `⌥⌘F`
4. Toggle on "Find in selection" with `⌥⌘L`
5. Replace all with `⌘↩`

Visual Studio Code has a "Auto Find in Selection" option, but this breaks using `⌘E` and `⌘G` to iterate through matches in a document.
