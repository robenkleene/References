# Visual Studio Code Insiders

## Switching

- Settings should already be synced, but pull the `git` repo if not
- The CLI alias `vs` should choose the correct version based on what's running automatically
- Extensions need to be synced manually.
- For Vim, the `snippets.textmateSnippetsRoots` needs to be updated in `coc-settings.json`.
- Remember to sync to the dev server too:
    - Run `Remote: Install Local Extensions in <host>...`
    - Update load my extension with `Extensions: Install from VSIX...`
