# Visual Studio Code Window Management

## Window Management

- `⌘1` Focus editor
- `⌃backtick`: Toggle Terminal
- `⌘B`: Toggle sidebar
- `⌘J`: Toggle bottom panel

There's no shortcut to join editors, but "View: Single Column Editor Layout" is a command that does this.

### Sidebar

- `⌘0`: Focus currently active sidebar
- `⇧⌘E`: Focus Explorer (files)

### Splits

- `⌘⌥0`: Toggle between horizontal and vertical splits
- `⌘\`: Split the editor vertically
- `⌘K ⌘\`: Split editor horizontally
- `⌘⌥←` / `⌘⌥→`: Focus left / right editor

The tab navigation keys (`⇧⌘[` / `⇧⌘]`) also work to go between side-by-side splits.

## Explorer

- `⌃↩`: Open file in a split
- `␣`: Open file

## Quick Open

After using `⌘P` to fuzzy open a file:

- `↩`: Opens in a new tab
- `⌘↩`: Opens in a new vertical split
- `⌥↩`: Opens in a new vertical split
- `⌃↩`: Opens in a new vertical split

There does not appear to be a way to open a file from Quick Open in a horizontal split, as a workaround, first open the file in vertical split and then use `⌘⌥0` to swap the layout.
